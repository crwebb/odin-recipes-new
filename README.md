A basic recipe site to learn HTML.

With this project I gained a greater understanding into:

- html file structure

- gained greater awareness around content being accessible 

- Visual studio code

- html elements for creating and structuring content

- anchor tags & img elements including absolute & relative link methodologies 

- git commands, better git practices, improved commit messages

- command line commands & working web dev file structures

- git hub repo cloning and tracking on git hub

- Applying CSS styling from an external sheet to all the different page elements
