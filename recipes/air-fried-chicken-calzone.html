            <p>Fresh baby spinach, marinara, mozzarella, and cooked chicken breast are stuffed in this air-fried calzone. Serve with more marinara sauce for dipping.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                <li>¼ cup finely chopped red onion</li>
                <li>3 cups baby spinach leaves</li>
                <li>⅓ cup low-sodium marinara sauce</li>
                <li>⅓ cup shredded cooked chicken breast</li>
                <li>6 ounces prepared pizza dough</li>
                <li>⅓ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in spinach; cover and cook until wilted, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in marinara and chicken.</li> <br>

                <li>Step 2: Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.</li> <br>

                <li>Step 3: Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece on a lightly floured work surface into a 6-inch circle. Spread 1/4 of the spinach mixture over the bottom half of each dough circle. Top each with 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese. Fold dough over filling to form half-moons and crimp edges to seal. Coat well with cooking spray.</li> <br>

                <li>Step 4: Transfer calzone to the air fryer basket. Cook for 8 minutes. Turn calzone over; cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes more.</li> <br>
